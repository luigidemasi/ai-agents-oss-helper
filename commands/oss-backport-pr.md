# Backport PR

Cherry-pick a merged pull request onto a maintenance or release branch and open a backport PR.

## Usage

```
/oss-backport-pr <pr> branch=<target-branch>
```

**Arguments:**
- `<pr>` - Pull request identifier: number (e.g., `42`) or full URL (e.g., `https://github.com/org/repo/pull/42`)
- `branch=<target-branch>` - The target branch to backport onto (e.g., `release/1.x`, `camel-4.8.x`)

## Instructions

### 1. Initialize Project Context

**MANDATORY:** First, read and process the `.oss-init.md` file to detect the current project and load its rules. All subsequent steps assume the project context (project-info, project-standards, project-guidelines) is loaded.

### 2. Parse Input

Extract the PR identifier and the target branch from the arguments:

- If a number is provided: use as-is
- If a full URL (e.g., `https://github.com/org/repo/pull/42`): extract the number from the path
- If `branch=` is missing: **STOP** and ask the user:
  > Please specify the target branch. Usage: `/oss-backport-pr <pr> branch=<target-branch>`

### 3. Validate the Source PR

Fetch the source PR metadata:

```bash
gh pr view <PR_NUMBER> --repo <GITHUB_REPO> --json number,title,state,mergeCommit,headRefName,baseRefName,body,labels,author
```

Validate:
- The PR **must be merged**. If not, **STOP** and inform the user:
  > PR #<NUMBER> is not merged (state: <state>). Only merged PRs can be backported.
- Extract the merge commit SHA from `mergeCommit.oid`

### 4. Validate the Target Branch

Verify the target branch exists on the remote:

```bash
git ls-remote --heads origin <TARGET_BRANCH>
```

If the branch does not exist, **STOP** and inform the user:
> Target branch `<TARGET_BRANCH>` does not exist on the remote. Available branches can be listed with `git branch -r`.

### 5. Fetch and Identify Commits to Cherry-Pick

Fetch the latest remote state:

```bash
git fetch origin <TARGET_BRANCH>
```

Get the list of commits from the source PR:

```bash
gh pr view <PR_NUMBER> --repo <GITHUB_REPO> --json commits --jq '.commits[].oid'
```

This returns the individual commits that were part of the PR (in order). These are the commits to cherry-pick, preserving the original commit history rather than using the squashed merge commit.

If the PR was squash-merged (only one commit returned, or the merge commit differs from the PR commits), use the merge commit SHA instead:

```bash
gh pr view <PR_NUMBER> --repo <GITHUB_REPO> --json mergeCommit --jq '.mergeCommit.oid'
```

### 6. Create the Backport Branch

Create a new branch from the target branch:

```bash
git checkout -b backport/<PR_NUMBER>-to-<TARGET_BRANCH_SLUG> origin/<TARGET_BRANCH>
```

Where `<TARGET_BRANCH_SLUG>` is the target branch name with `/` replaced by `-` (e.g., `release/1.x` becomes `release-1.x`).

### 7. Cherry-Pick the Commits

Cherry-pick the commits onto the backport branch:

```bash
git cherry-pick <COMMIT_SHA_1> <COMMIT_SHA_2> ...
```

If cherry-pick **succeeds**: proceed to step 8.

If cherry-pick **fails with conflicts**:

1. List the conflicted files:
   ```bash
   git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U
   ```

2. Attempt to resolve the conflicts by reading the conflicted files, understanding the context of both sides, and applying the changes from the source PR in a way that makes sense for the target branch.

3. After resolving each file, stage it:
   ```bash
   git add <file>
   ```

4. Continue the cherry-pick:
   ```bash
   git cherry-pick --continue
   ```

5. If conflicts are **too complex to resolve automatically** (e.g., the target branch has diverged significantly and the changes cannot be applied cleanly), abort the cherry-pick and **STOP**:
   ```bash
   git cherry-pick --abort
   git checkout -
   git branch -D backport/<PR_NUMBER>-to-<TARGET_BRANCH_SLUG>
   ```
   Inform the user:
   > Cherry-pick failed due to conflicts that require manual resolution. Conflicted files:
   > - `<file1>`
   > - `<file2>`
   >
   > You may want to manually cherry-pick and resolve the conflicts.

### 8. Sanity Build (MANDATORY before push)

For **Maven projects**, verify the cherry-picked commits build cleanly on the target branch before pushing. From the **repository root**.

**Before running, ask the user** which build to run (use `AskUserQuestion`):
- **(a) Skip tests** (default for backports — backport correctness is assumed to be validated upstream; the goal is a compile-and-wire sanity check across the full reactor): `mvn clean install -DskipTests`
- **(b) Run full tests** (slower, useful when the maintenance branch differs significantly from main): `mvn clean install`

Do NOT pick a default silently — wait for the user's choice. Both options run the **full reactor build** — do NOT add `-pl` or `-am` flags. A scoped build only covers the changed module and its upstream dependencies, leaving downstream generators (project-wide catalogs, DSL builder factories, metadata mirrors) stale.

This catches API drift between the source and target branches (e.g., a method used by the backport was renamed on the target branch).

Skip this step entirely for non-Maven projects (Go via `make`, yarn, docs-only).

If the build fails:
1. Inspect the failure — it usually indicates a missing dependency commit or a signature change on the target branch.
2. Either cherry-pick the missing prerequisite commits, resolve manually, or abort:
   ```bash
   git checkout -
   git branch -D backport/<PR_NUMBER>-to-<TARGET_BRANCH_SLUG>
   ```
   and inform the user which prerequisite is missing.
3. Do NOT push on a failing root build.

### 9. Push the Backport Branch

```bash
git push -u origin backport/<PR_NUMBER>-to-<TARGET_BRANCH_SLUG>
```

### 10. Create the Backport PR

Open a pull request from the backport branch to the target branch:

```bash
gh pr create --repo <GITHUB_REPO> \
  --base <TARGET_BRANCH> \
  --head backport/<PR_NUMBER>-to-<TARGET_BRANCH_SLUG> \
  --title "[backport <TARGET_BRANCH>] <ORIGINAL_PR_TITLE>" \
  --label "backport" \
  --body "$(cat <<'PREOF'
## Backport of #<PR_NUMBER>

Cherry-pick of #<PR_NUMBER> onto `<TARGET_BRANCH>`.

**Original PR:** #<PR_NUMBER> - <ORIGINAL_PR_TITLE>
**Original author:** @<ORIGINAL_AUTHOR>
**Target branch:** `<TARGET_BRANCH>`

### Original description

<ORIGINAL_PR_BODY or "See original PR for details.">
PREOF
)"
```

If the `backport` label does not exist, create the PR without it rather than failing.

### 11. Report Result

Provide the user with:

```markdown
## Backport Complete

- **Source PR:** #<PR_NUMBER> - <TITLE>
- **Backport PR:** #<NEW_PR_NUMBER> - <NEW_PR_URL>
- **Target branch:** `<TARGET_BRANCH>`
- **Commits cherry-picked:** <N>
- **Conflicts resolved:** <yes/no>

Use `/oss-pr-status <NEW_PR_NUMBER>` to monitor the backport PR.
```

### 12. Constraints

You MUST:
- Verify the source PR is merged before attempting the backport
- Verify the target branch exists
- Preserve the original commit messages during cherry-pick
- Link the backport PR back to the original PR
- Clean up the local backport branch if the process fails
- Report conflicts clearly if they cannot be resolved

You MUST NOT:
- Backport PRs that are not merged
- Modify the original PR in any way
- Force-push to the target branch directly
- Skip conflict resolution without informing the user
- Create the backport PR if cherry-pick failed

### 13. Acceptance Criteria

- Source PR is validated as merged
- Target branch is validated as existing
- Commits are cherry-picked onto a new backport branch
- Backport PR is opened with proper title, body, and label
- Original PR is referenced in the backport PR body
- Conflicts are either resolved or clearly reported
- User receives the backport PR URL
